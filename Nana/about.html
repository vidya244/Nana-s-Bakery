          <p>Nana's Bakery Cafe was inspired by our family's love for home baked goods and pastries. Every item we carry has been tested tried and true in our home kitchen and is now available in our bakery, located in Carmichael, California.

You will be hard pressed to find beautiful, delectable, and unforgettable cakes, cookies, and pastries like ours, anywhere else. Each item is made in-house from scratch with special care. We use only high quality ingredients in our perfected and delicious recipes because we believe that quality starts at home.

Born out of an Armenian culture, it is ingrained in our family to feed those we love with only the best of what we have. So with that at the forefront of our business model, our vision is to bring to our community: the art of baking with love. Let us fill your life with sweetness and we promise it will be an experience for the books.
<br>

<b>From our family to yours, thank you for becoming a part of our vision.</b>

<br>Welcome to Nana's Bakery. </p>
